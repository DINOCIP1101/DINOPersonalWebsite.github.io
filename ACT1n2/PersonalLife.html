To be honest, I am not enjoying my college life in an academic perspective.<sup>2</sup> I feel like this is not for me and I want to be doing something that I enjoy doing.<sup>3</sup> After a long time being in online classes, I find it hard to adjust and go back to the way it used to.<sup>4</sup> I had a difficult time in to thinking what course I want to take, what school do I want to go on, etc.<sup>5</sup> I will admit that half of my adulting years, I had no clear direction in life.<sup>6</sup> I don't know what I want to pursue and I don't know if I can manage to achieve it.<sup>7</sup>I felt like I had no other choice than to go with I.T course.<sup>8</sup>Not that I dislike it, It did cross my mind before but I have realized that it isn't something that I see myself doing for a long time.<sup>9</sup>So basically, my life felt like it started to go on a rabbit hole again.<sup>10</sup>I felt pressured because the time was moving too quickly.<sup>11</sup>I felt useless most of the time because I thought at this point, I should be doing more in life.<sup>12</sup>That is when I met Gab.<sup>13</sup> I feel like it is worth mentioning her because I consider her the turning point of my life.<sup>14</sup> As cheesy as it sounds but I am very thankful to have met her in this phase of my life.<sup>15</sup>She has given me a reason to look forward to the days to come.<sup>16</sup> She has given me hope for the future.<sup>17</sup> I will forever be grateful to have met her and I am thankful that I can call her my girlfriend.<sup>18</sup> Right now I am happy with where I am today.<sup>19</sup> I started to take things slow.<sup>20</sup> I met a lot of good people that I can call my friends.<sup>21</sup> I'm still spoiled by my parents but I have learned to not ask for too much and they are okay with it. They also have taught me that Time is important and I shouldn't waste every moment.<sup>22</sup> I met someone who is very important to me and has taught me to take on life, One day at a time and live my life at my own pace.<sup>23</sup></p></blockquote>
