	<blockquote><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seoul, the vibrant capital city of South Korea, is a destination that offers visitors a glimpse into the country's rich history, vibrant culture, and modern technological advancements. The city's stunning blend of ancient and modern architecture, as well as its fascinating street markets and cutting-edge skyscrapers, make it an exciting place to explore. One of the city's most iconic attractions is Gyeongbokgung Palace, which was built in the 14th century and has undergone extensive restoration over the years. This vast complex once had more than 7,000 rooms and was the seat of power for the Joseon dynasty. Visitors can stroll through the palace's spacious courtyards, admire its intricate architecture, and even witness the changing of the guard ceremony. Another must-visit attraction in Seoul is the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a striking conference center that features a futuristic curved design and a rooftop garden. This modern architectural masterpiece hosts fashion shows, exhibitions, and other cultural events throughout the year.</p></blockquote>
